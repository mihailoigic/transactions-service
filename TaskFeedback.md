Since the estimated time for this project was around 5 hours, I definitely went over that, but still didnâ€™t have enough time to implement everything I had in mind. I aimed for a straightforward approach and tried to avoid unnecessary complexity, but some parts, especially on the backend, required more attention, which is why I likely spent more time there than expected.

For the frontend, I kept things as simple as possible. Unfortunately, I didnâ€™t manage to implement all the intended features, such as edit functionality or proper table refresh after adding or deleting entries. I prepared filtering, pagination, and a few more backend features, but didnâ€™t have time to wire them up on the frontend.

Additionally, I used Next.js and styled-components, which are not my current day to day tools, so there was a bit of a learning curve that slowed me down slightly. Still, I did my best given the constraints ðŸ˜„
